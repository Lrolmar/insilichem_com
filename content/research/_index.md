# `Research overview`

***

InSiliChem is a _molecular modeling_ group with expertise in a wide variety of methods that range from homology modeling, molecular dynamics, protein-ligand dockings or QM based methods. It focuses on two lines namely 1) computer based molecular design and 2) interactions of exogenous compouds with living organisms. In both lines, most activities are centered on metal containing systems for which the team has been acquiring major expertise over the years.
To sustain its investigation, in the last years, the group has also deployed substantial efforts to the development of new software in which GaudiMM is the sparehead.

# `Molecular Design`

## Artificial Metalloenzymes design.

The development of sustainable biocatalytic plateforms occupies a preferential position in the green chemistry agenda. The modification of natural enzymes offers of the most immediate and stable stategies. Nature's enzymatic repertoire though only covers a reduced scope of the current need of the chemical indrustries. As a consequence, a lot of investigation is undergone nowadays to generate _de novo_ enzymes which activity are absent in Nature. Amongst the most promising approaches are those that, somehow, copy the mechanism of hemozymes and in which a synthetic homogeneous catalyst is embedded into a biological scaffold. The resulting biohybrids present many challenges in particular when it comes to control several of key molecular factors like to ascertain the exact location of the cofactor, of the substrate as well as help to design new variants with specific activities. Our group has pioneered many reseaches in this field which include the development of computational integrative strategies including docking, MD and QM (QM/MM) approaches. We also tripled our efforts to update the computational framework with predictive tools for the binding of metallic species to protein scaffold. We are lucky to enjoy collaboration with international leaders in the field like Profs. Thomas Ward (Basel), Gerard Roelfes (Groningen) and Jean-Pierre Mahy (Orsay)

## Metallodrug design

Since the emergence of cis-platin as a key player in the fight against cancer, numerous drug design projects have been built around metalloligands. Similar to artificial metalloenzymes, molecular modeling on this field requires methodologies optimized for the simulation of bio-inorganic adducts. We apply and test the latests updates in force field approaches in our studies on metallodrugs but, more than antyhing else, we pioneer developments of metal compatible protein-ligand docking software that give insights to where and how could metal containing species bind to a biological target. In the recent years, we have been particularly active in showing how computational framework like ours can be vital to predict accurately the binding of metallodrugs to their target when combined with spectroscopic methods. In this, our collaboration with Prof. Eugenio Garribba (University of Sassari, Italy) has been of the most successful.

## Artificial Metallopeptides

Metallopeptides are crucial in many medicinal fields and have also shown to be particularly relevant as supramolecular scaffold. Here again, we combine different level of theory to ascertain the most stable structure of artificial metallopeptides, follow their dynamical behavior and, more recently, predict their binding to key biological partners. Here again we use multi-level approaches and more recently adapted version of GaudiMM on this precise problem. The most representative applicative work on this line is performed in collaboration with Prof. E. Vazquez and M. Vazquez (University of Santiago de Compostela)

## Supramolecular chemistry

A recent line of research of the group led between professors Mar√©chal and Ujaque deals with the suported catalysis by supromolecular molecules and more particularly nanocages. Quite orphan from modeling inputs to date, this line of research has a huge potential in which the expertise we gain on catalytic systems and large biomolecular entities are applied with success.

# `Biomedicine and Exogenous compounds`

The interaction of exogenous compounds with living organisms are key for many of their functions but also a source of many diseases. The second main line of research of the group focuses on predicting at the molecular level key interactions between thos exogenous compounds and their target in humans or other organisms. We center our activities on two categories of exogenous, mostly metal ions and natural compounds from pharmacophea. In humans we focus on metabolism enzymes (e.g. cytochromes P450), neurodegenerative disorder and metal related diseases. For non-human organisms, we focus on pathogenic illnesses like malaria, dengue and more recently covid-19.

## Neurodegenerative diseases

Metal-beta amyloid

## Metabolism and small molecules-P450 interactions

## Identifying natural product positioning.

## Metal binding prediction


# `Software and Methological Developments`

InSiliChem studies embark a variety of different modeling questions. From sequence analysis, protein-ligand dockings to QM/MM InSiliChem owns expertise that allows to work on very different systems. However, InSiliChem main focuses on systems with little structural information has urge to the development of computational softwares in the last 10 years.
