# `Research overview.`

***

InSiliChem is a _molecular modeling_ group with expertise in a wide variety of methods that range from homology modeling, molecular dynamics, protein-ligand dockings or QM based methods. It focuses on two non orthogonal research lines namely 1) computer based molecular design and 2) computational bioinorganics.

To sustain its investigation, in the last years, the group has also deployed substantial efforts to the development of new software in which GaudiMM represents the sparehead.

# `Molecular Design`

## Artificial Metalloenzymes design.

Part of de novo enzyme design, those systems are biohybrids obtained by the incorporation of homogeneous catalysts into proteic hosts. Our group has pioneer many reseaches...collaboration with....

## Metallodrug design

Since the emergence of cis-platin as a key player in the fight against cancer, numerous drug design projects have been built around metalloligands. Similar to artificial metalloenzymes, molecular modeling on this field requires methodologies optimized for the simulation of bio-inorganic adducts. We apply and test the latests updates in force field approaches in our studies on metallodrugs but, more than antyhing else, we pioneer developments of metal compatible protein-ligand docking software that give insights to where and how could metal containing species bind to a biological target.

## Artificial Metallopeptides

Metallopeptides are crucial in many medicinal fields and have also shown to be particularly relevant as supramolecular scaffold. Here again, we combine different level of theory to ascertain the most stable structure of artificial metallopeptides, follow their dynamical behavior and, more recently, predict their binding to key biological partners.

## Supramolecular chemistry

A recent line of research of the group led between professors Mar√©chal and Ujaque deals with the suported catalysis by supromolecular molecules and more particularly nanocages. Quite orphan from modeling inputs to date, this line of research has a huge potential in which the expertise we gain on catalytic systems and large biomolecular entities are applied with success.

# `Biomedicine and Exogenous compounds` 

The interaction of exogenous compounds with living organisms are key for many of their functions but also a source of failure. Being 

# `Software and Methological Developments`

InSilichem studies embark a variety of different modeling questions. From sequence analysis, protein-ligand dockings to QM/MM insilichem owns expertise that allows to work on very different systems. However, Insilichem main focuses on systems with little structural information has urge to the development of computational softwares in the last 10 years.
