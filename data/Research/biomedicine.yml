top_heading   :  Biomedicine and Exogenous compounds
definition : >
  The interaction of exogenous compounds with living organisms are key for many of their functions but also a source of many diseases. The second main line of 
  research of the group focuses on predicting at the molecular level key interactions between thos exogenous compounds and their target in humans or other organisms. 
  We center our activities on two categories of exogenous, mostly metal ions and natural compounds from pharmacophea. In humans we focus on metabolism enzymes 
  (e.g. cytochromes P450), neurodegenerative disorder and metal related diseases. For non-human organisms, we focus on pathogenic illnesses like malaria, dengue 
  and more recently covid-19.
