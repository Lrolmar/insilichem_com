  - title : Artificial Metalloenzymes design
    description: > 
      The development of sustainable biocatalytic plateforms occupies a preferential position in the green chemistry agenda. The modification of natural enzymes 
      offers of the most immediate and stable stategies. Nature's enzymatic repertoire though only covers a reduced scope of the current need of the chemical indrustries. As a 
      consequence, a lot of investigation is undergone nowadays to generate _de novo_ enzymes which activity are absent in Nature. Amongst the most promising approaches are 
      those that, somehow, copy the mechanism of hemozymes and in which a synthetic homogeneous catalyst is embedded into a biological scaffold. The resulting biohybrids present
      many challenges in particular when it comes to control several of key molecular factors like to ascertain the exact location of the cofactor, of the substrate as well as 
      help to design new variants with specific activities. Our group has pioneered many reseaches in this field which include the development of computational integrative 
      strategies including docking, MD and QM (QM/MM) approaches. We also tripled our efforts to update the computational framework with predictive tools for the binding of 
      metallic species to protein scaffold. We are lucky to enjoy collaboration with international leaders in the field like Profs. Thomas Ward (Basel), Gerard Roelfes 
      (Groningen) and Jean-Pierre Mahy (Orsay)

  - title : Metallodrug design
    description: > 
      Since the emergence of cis-platin as a key player in the fight against cancer, numerous drug design projects have been built around metalloligands. Similar to 
      artificial metalloenzymes, molecular modeling on this field requires methodologies optimized for the simulation of bio-inorganic adducts. We apply and test the 
      latests updates in force field approaches in our studies on metallodrugs but, more than antyhing else, we pioneer developments of metal compatible protein-ligand 
      docking software that give insights to where and how could metal containing species bind to a biological target. In the recent years, we have been particularly 
      active in showing how computational framework like ours can be vital to predict accurately the binding of metallodrugs to their target when combined with 
      spectroscopic methods. In this, our collaboration with Prof. Eugenio Garribba (University of Sassari, Italy) has been of the most successful.

  - title : Artificial Metallopeptides
    description: >
      Metallopeptides are crucial in many medicinal fields and have also shown to be particularly relevant as supramolecular scaffold. Here again, we combine 
      different level of theory to ascertain the most stable structure of artificial metallopeptides, follow their dynamical behavior and, more recently, predict their binding 
      o key biological partners. Here again we use multi-level approaches and more recently adapted version of GaudiMM on this precise problem. The most representative 
      applicative work on this line is performed in collaboration with Prof. E. Vazquez and M. Vazquez (University of Santiago de Compostela)

  - title : Supramolecular chemistry
    description: >
      A recent line of research of the group led between professors Mar√©chal and Ujaque deals with the suported catalysis by supromolecular molecules 
      and more particularly nanocages. Quite orphan from modeling inputs to date, this line of research has a huge potential in which the expertise we gain on catalytic 
      systems and large biomolecular entities are applied with success.
