  InSiliChem studies embark a variety of different modeling questions.
  From sequence analysis, protein-ligand dockings to QM/MM InSiliChem
  owns expertise that allows to work on very different systems. However,
  InSiliChem main focuses on systems with little structural information
  has urge to the development of computational softwares in the
  last 10 years. <br><br>
