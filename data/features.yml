        Our mission is to develop and apply molecular modeling tools for the design of pharmacologically or biotechnologically active molecules.
  - title : The Strategy
    description: > 
        The computation of complex systems is generally a long shot. In most of our research, more than one method is needed for an accurate prediction i.e. Quantum Chemistry and large scale Molecular Dynamics.
        Since feeding molecular modeling programs from one to another is of the most tedious and source of errors in computational chemistry, we and others are betting on multiscale/integrative/multilevel approaches that conveniently combine in a unique protocol.

    description: >
        Our software developments are centred on two axis.
        1) To accelerate our multiscale studies, we develop software and interfaces that could ease management of input and output files. In collaboration with the team of the UCSF Chimera, we areÂ implementing novel interface between Homology Modeling, Molecular Dynamics, QM/MM, protein-ligand docking approaches.
        2) Most of our work also involves major exploration of chemical and conformational space. As current state-of-the-art programs do not consider both exploration spaces, we are intensively working on a genetic algorithm based architecture for this end.
